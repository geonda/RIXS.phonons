# Package for calculating  phonon contribution in RIXS
currently there are 4 examples:

- example_simple - produces phonon contribution for single displaced harmonic osc

- example_2d - compares 2 coupled phonon modes problem with single mode solutions
- example_dd - includes distortion along with displacement of an excited state harmonic osc
               (takes times to run)
- example_q - input phonon energy and coupling constant (vs q) are in the phonon_info.py for now;  only three phonon contribution are active; qx - q total vector
