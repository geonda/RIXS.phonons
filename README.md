# Package for calculating  phonon contribution in RIXS

Objective of this package is to create convenient tool for fitting experimental data and subtracting electron-phonon coupling values  from phonon contribution to resonant inelastic X-ray scattering cross-section.

Package currently contains:
- Model for 1D harmonic oscillator interacting with single electronic level.
- Model for 2D harmonic oscillator (two modes active).
- Model for 1D harmonic oscillator which is distorted and displaced in the excited state (excited state potential energy surface (PES) differs from ground state PES).

### Installation :
It is a python based package and too install it you can simply run in terminal : 

`$pip install phlab`

Download example folder from this page and use it as a tamplate for your projects. You may want to use Jupyter Notebooks from examples. If you don't have [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/documentation) install it  via `pip` as well :

`$pip install jupyterlab`
