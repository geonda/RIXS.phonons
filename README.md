# Package for calculating  phonon contribution in RIXS

This package aims to create a convenient set of tools for fitting experimental data and subtracting electron-phonon coupling values from phonon contribution in resonant inelastic X-ray scattering cross-section.

It currently includes:

- Model for 1D harmonic oscillator interacting with a single electronic level.
- Model for 2D harmonic oscillator (two modes active).
- Model for 1D harmonic oscillator, distorted and displaced in the excited state (excited-state potential energy surface (PES), differs from the ground state PES).

### Installation :
It is a python based package and too install it you can simply run in terminal : 

`$pip install phlab`

Download example folder from this page and use it as a tamplate for your projects. You may want to use Jupyter Notebooks from examples. If you don't have [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/documentation) install it  via `pip` as well :

`$pip install jupyterlab`
