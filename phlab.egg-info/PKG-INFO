Description: # Package for calculating  phonon contribution in RIXS
        
        Objective of this package is to create convenient tool for fitting experimental data and subtracting electron-phonon coupling values  from phonon contribution to resonant inelastic X-ray scattering cross-section.
        
        Package currently contains:
        - Model for 1D harmonic oscillator interacting with single electronic level.
        - Model for 2D harmonic oscillator (two modes active).
        - Model for 1D harmonic oscillator which is distorted and displaced in the excited state (excited state potential energy surface (PES) differs from ground state PES).
