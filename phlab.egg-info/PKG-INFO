Description: # Package for calculating  phonon contribution in RIXS
        currently there are 4 examples:
        
        - example_simple - produces phonon contribution using the model of single displaced harmonic osc
        
        ![img](/img/test.png)
        
        
        - example_2d - compares 2 coupled phonon modes problem with single mode solutions
        - example_dd - includes distortion along with displacement of an excited state harmonic osc
                       (takes times to run)
        - example_q - input phonon energy and coupling constant (vs q) are in the phonon_info.py for now;  only three phonon contribution are active; qx - q total vector
