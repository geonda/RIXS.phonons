About phlab
===========

This package aims to create a convenient set of tools for fitting experimental data and subtracting electron-phonon coupling values from phonon contribution in resonant inelastic X-ray scattering cross-section.

It currently includes:
- Model for 1D harmonic oscillator interacting with a single electronic level.
- Model for 2D harmonic oscillator (two modes active).
- Model for 1D harmonic oscillator, distorted and displaced in the excited state (excited-state potential energy surface (PES), differs from the ground state PES).
