# Package for calculating  phonon contribution in RIXS
currently there are 4 examples:
to modify/print inputs see dictionary : workspace().dict_total

*example_simple - produces phonon contribution for single displaced harmonic osc
*example_2d - compares 2 coupled phonon modes problem with single mode solutions
*example_dd - shows effect of distortion along with displacement of an excited state harmonic osc
               (takes times)

*example_q - input phonon energy and coupling constant (vs q) is in the phonon_info.py for now
           - only three phonon contribution
           - qx - q total vector
