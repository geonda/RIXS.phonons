# Package for calculating  phonon contribution in RIXS
currently there three examples:
- example_simple - produces phonon contribution for single displaced harmonic osc
- example_2d - compares 2 coupled phonon modes problem with single mode solutions
- example_dd - shows effect of distortion of an excited state harmonic osc
              along with displacement
